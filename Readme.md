# ML Project with FastAPI

This project serves machine learning models (Deep Neural Network) via a FastAPI-based REST API.

## File Structure

- `models/`: Contains the trained model files.
- `app/`: Contains the FastAPI app and its components.
- `data/`: Sample input data for testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook for training the models.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd ml_project

# How to run

1. First run the requirments.txt file to install the dependencies.
2. Then run the notebook code and save the model.
3. Test the model prediction by using fast api route
